React Component:

types: Class based and functional component.
Functional is majorly used.

What is React functional component?
- Just a normal JS function which returns some piece of JSX.
- A JS function which returns react element.

We cannot render react component directly in the render method.
We have to make it a tag.

Component composition: We can use other components in any component using angular brackets similar to the html tag.

Babel just transpiles every JSX into react element and react just displays it.

We can use function keyword to create functional component but the arrow is the modern way.

We can write any JS code in JSX using the curly braces({}).
We can even console.log in it.

We have to use {} to use react Element(or JSX way to create react element) in the react element as it is the js object.

React sanitizes the data that is used in component or react element. Which prevents cross site scripting attacks.

We can even call the functional component as a function inside curly braces in other functional component.

Following are the ways we can use functional component inside another functional component:
- {Title()}
- <Title />
- <Title>ABCCCC</Title>
